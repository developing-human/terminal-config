# dotfiles
My configuration for linux.  Intended to live in one location and have 
their normal config locations point to it via symbolic links.

Currently includes:
 - terminal based tools:
     - alacritty
     - nvim
     - tmux
 - desktop environment
     - dunst (notifications)
     - hypr (hyprland, hypridle, hyprlock)
     - walker + elephant (application launcher)
     - waybar (status bar)

Call `./setup.sh` to link the usual locations.
