# terminal-config
My configurations for terminal based tools.  Intended to live in one
location and have their normal config locations point to it via symbolic
links.

Currently includes:
 - alacritty
 - nvim
 - tmux
 - dunst
 - hypr (hyprland, hypridle, hyprlock)
 - waybar

Call `./setup.sh` to link the usual locations.  These locations are correct at 
least on Fedora and MacOS.
